"# Tic-Tac-Toe" 


I created a tic-tac-toe mobile app for Android using Java as part of a group project. I added bonus features such as multiple game modes (2-player vs. AI), enabling personalization options like choosing the board size, win conditions, and player markers. Users can also personalize their experience by creating and selecting avatars. Gameplay statistics are tracked using a leaderboard. In-game features include a timer, undo moves, notifications, and messages. :)
